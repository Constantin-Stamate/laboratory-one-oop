# 🎬 Movie Store – OOP Lab 1

This Java console application simulates a basic **Movie Store**, allowing users to manage a collection of movies by genre, release year, and rating. It demonstrates fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as encapsulation, composition, and method-based filtering.

---

## 💻 Laboratory Context

This project was developed as part of **Laboratory 1** for the course **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** at the **Technical University of Moldova (UTM)**.

---

## 🧩 Structure

The project contains 3 main Java classes:

### 1. `Movie.java`

Represents a single movie object with the following attributes:
- `title` – the name of the movie
- `director` – director's name
- `genre` – movie genre (e.g., Action, Sci-Fi)
- `releaseYear` – year of release
- `rating` – rating score (e.g., IMDb)

---

### 2. `MovieStore.java`

Handles a list of movies and provides filtering and sorting operations.

**Key methods:**

- `addMovie(Movie movie)` – adds a movie to the store  
- `filterByGenre(String genre)` – returns a list of movies by genre  
- `sortByReleaseYear()` – returns movies sorted by release year  
- `getRatedMovies(int n)` – returns top n rated movies  

---

### 3. `Main.java`

Entry point of the application that:

- Creates a MovieStore  
- Adds several movies  
- Demonstrates filtering, sorting, and rating-based selection
